## About Us

**ARC** stands for **Ambition, Resilience, Creativity** – values that define our journey as a team. The logo represents more than just letters; it symbolizes connection, growth, and collaboration.

The letters A, R, and C also come from our names:
- **MikAy** (Mikaella Summer Gorgonio)
- **Raj** (Raymund Raj D. Go)
- **Cyrus** (John Cyrus M. Yleana)

Together, we form **TEAM ARC** – a team dedicated to innovation, teamwork, and impact.
